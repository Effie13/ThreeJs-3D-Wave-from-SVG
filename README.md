# ThreeJs-3D-Wave-from-SVG
3D Wave from SVG animation. Optimize lots of objects. Load SVG file and render its context in 3D scene to animate later.

Version 1:

Contains working code but not optimized. Renders slowly. It simply loads the SVG file, reads data with a loop and creates lots of circle objects to get the desired final image. Not acceptable performance.

Instance Optimization:

First attempt to optimize the objects using InstancedMesh(). Working example but not yet perfect.
